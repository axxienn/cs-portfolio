        Motherboard is a computer's central in which allows different parts
        of the computer to be gathered at one place and communicate with 
        each other. It is commonly found in PCs, and looks like a mini 
        contraption on plastic board. The different components would
        potentially include a CPU, RAM, and multiple USB ports. It is also 
        known as "the heart of the computer".
        Originally in the 1980s, motherboards were made for computers since 
        they were structured much bigger
        (approximately the size of a chromebook) than the modern
        motherboards. It was also extremely wired because the 
        invention of computer buses didn't exist yet. 
        But as our technology advances, the size of 
        motherboards changed drastically. 
        However, most components don't get removed but are 
        reduced in size and switched positions instead. These
        adjustments are mainly made for the efficiency of a 
        computer bus.

        CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, or known as the brain
        of the computer. It is a computer's primary component and
        is responsible for translating your instructions or commands
        into action. And in order to carry out the inputs, the CPU also
        contains other units such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
        and the control unit (CU).

        RAM is an accronym for random access memory. It stores memories
        temporarily and use it to carry out certain instruction on hand.
        The "random access" is the result of its ability to store
        information from any location. There are two types of RAM: DRAM
        and SRAM. DRAM normally would be found in a PC, but SRAM is
        more reliable when it comes to speed and off power access.

        Unlike RAM, hard drive is a permanent storage that is saved on
        the computer. Common downloads a hard drive would save includes 
        pictures, music/audio, movies, preferences, and the system.

        Since different computer parts are unable to interact with one
        another on its own, one or more computer buses are necessary in 
        order to get the different components of a computer to
        communicate with each other. A computer bus comes in a form of
        cables and printed circuits. Rather than having multiple
        connections between components, a computer bus provides one
        long connection through the components to keep the
        interaction more efficient and organized.

            A monitor is the device that sums up all the operations
            and put it on a visual display.
