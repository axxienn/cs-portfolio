     <h1 id="h1"> About Me </h1>
     
  
        <p id="words"> My name is Annie Deng, currently a sophomore at Summit Shasta. I am
           passionate about traveling. So far in my fifteen years, I've been to Thailand, 
            China, and Hong Kong. One of my top items that I'm dying to own 
            is a DSLR. It is common to take pictures on trips and vacations, 
            but all I have is my phone to capture the memories. </p>  
    

            
        <p id="words2"> Another two hobbies I like would be hanging out with friends and running short 
        distance. When going out, food is always necessary to shop for.
        My love for food, especially potatoes, runs ocean deep. I don't
        have a favorite book, but I enjoy reading action, thriller, romance, horror, and
        sci-fi. </p>
